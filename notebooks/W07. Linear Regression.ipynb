Before we run a regression, we must check that the assumptions in this case are satisfied. There are four main ones:\n",

Instead, we'll have to pick one of the categories (called a **base category**/**reference category**), and compare each of the other categories in that variable against this one.

        "Now that we've got a good sense of how regressions work and how to interpret them, we need to communicate these results properly. Many of you have probably read journal articles in which regression results are reported, but I doubt you've ever seen the output of `model.summary()` copied and pasted in the text of an article. Instead, these results are reported following a fairly standardized convention: a regression table. It picks out the components of the model summary that we're interested in, and formats them in a consistent and easy-to-interpret way. Luckly, the statsmodels package has a function called `summary_col` that takes a fitted model and formats it for us automatically; we just need to tweak a few options.\n",

I'm then going to create a regression table in which each column is a different regression model, and row will contain the coefficient for a given independent variable with the standard error in parentheses underneath and the level of statistical significance (i.e., size of the p-value) denotes by stars such that: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001."
